Basic Math Caculator

My final project for my Cs 110 class was to build anything but in java and for my first ever java project, I decieded to build a caculator as it will give me an understanding on how a caculator works and how i can implement 
that towards my goal of building a food caculator. 
For this project, I took it a step further by using java swing or gui system to make it more intresting and overall came out pretty good.
